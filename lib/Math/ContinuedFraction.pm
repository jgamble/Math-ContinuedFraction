=head1 NAME

Math::ContinuedFraction - Create and Manipulate Continued Fractions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Quick summary of what the module does.

Perhaps a little code snippet.

    use Math::ContinuedFraction;

    #
    # Create new continued fraction objects.
    #
    my $cf = Math::ContinuedFraction->new([1, 4, 9, 25]);
    my $cf_phi = Math::ContinuedFraction->new([1, [1]]);
 
    my $cf_67div29 = Math::ContinuedFraction->from_ratio(67, 29);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

Continued fractions are expressions of the form

         b1
    a1 + -------
               b2
          a2 + -------
	             b3
	        a3 + -------
	                ...

For most instances, the 'b' terms are 1, and the continued fraction
can be written as C<[a1, a2, a3, ...]>, etc. If the sequence of 'a' terms ends
at a certain point, the continued fraction is known as a finite continued
fraction, and can be exactly represented as a fraction. If the sequence of
'a' terms has a repeating sequence, it is normally written as

                 ______
    [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5]

where the line over a4 and a5 indicates that they repeat forever. Since we
can't use that method in perl code, we indicate the repeating portion by using an
array within the array:

    [a1, a2, a3, [a4, a5]]

Note that in the examples in the L</SYNOPSIS>, C<$cf_phi> is created using
that notation.

=head2 Methods to Create Continued Fraction Objects

=head3 new()

Create a new continued fraction object from an array.

    my $cf = Math::ContinuedFraction([1, [2, 1]]);

Arrays are in the form C<[finite_sequence, [repeating_sequence]]>. A continued fraction
with no repeating part simply omits the embedded array reference:

    my $cf = Math::ContinuedFraction([1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 5]);

=head3 from_ratio()

Generate a continued fraction from a pair of relatively prime numbers.

=head2 Methods to Return Information

=head3 convergent()

Returns the fraction formed by calculating the rational approximation
of the continued fraction at a stopping point, and returning the
numerator and denominator.

Convergent term counts begin at 1. Continued fractions with a repeating
component can effectively have a term count as high as you like. Finite
continued fractions will stop at the end of the sequence without warning.

    #
    # Find the ratios that approximate pi.
    #
    # The array stops at seven elements for simplicity's sake,
    # the sequence actually does not end.
    #
    my $cfpi = Math::ContinuedFraction([3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1]);

    for my $j (1..4)
    {
        my($n, $d) = cfpi->convergent($j);
        print $n->bstr() . "/". $d->bstr() . "\n";
    }

The values returned are objects of type Math::BigInt.

=head3 brconvergent()

Behaves identically to convergent(), but returns a single Math::BigRat
object instead of two Math::BigInt objects.

    #
    # Find the ratios that approximate pi.
    #
    # The array stops at seven elements for simplicity's sake,
    # the sequence actually does not end.
    #
    my $cfpi = Math::ContinuedFraction([3, 7, 15, 1, 292, 1, 1]);

    for my $j (1..4)
    {
        my $r = cfpi->brconvergent($j);
        print $r->bstr() . "\n";
    }


=head3 to_array()

Returns an array reference that can be used to create a continued fraction (see L</new()>).

    my $cf = Math::ContinuedFraction->from_ratio(0xfff1, 0x7fed);
    my $aref = $cf->to_array()
    my $cf2 = Math::ContinuedFraction->new($aref);

=head3 to_ascii()

Returns the string form of the array reference.

    my $cf = Math::ContinuedFraction->from_ratio(0xfff1, 0x7fed);
    print $cf->to_ascii(), "\n";

Returns C<[2, 1432, 1, 6, 1, 2]>.
