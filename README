Math-ContinuedFraction, Version 0.12

http://search.cpan.org/dist/Math-ContinuedFraction/

Create and manipulate continued fractions in perl.

This module is in an alpha state. Method names and parameters
may change in the next release, aside from the methods "new()"
and "from_ratio()". Fortunately, there aren't many other methods
beyond that.

Although the module uses Math::BigInt and Math::BigRat modules,
the internal calculations to create the continued fraction are
handled with perl's regular scalars. So far this hasn't been
a problem for the creation, and the convergent method does use
BigInts, so we're okay.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Build.PL
	./Build
	./Build test
	./Build install
