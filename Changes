Revision history for Math-ContinuedFraction

0.14
     2019-04-10
	- Failures from CPAN testers all point to Math::BigInt
	  with versions 1.999806 and 1.999807. It looks like maybe
	  there was an undefined value error fixed in 1.999810, but
	  I can't really tell from its CHANGES file, so let's just
	  specify the latest version (1.999816) in Build.PL.

     2019-04-09
	- End-of-array error in convergent() (which could result
	  in a divide-by-zero error) found and fixed by James Morse.
	- Gad. I never set a perl version limit. Currently set to 5.10.1.
	- Get Build.PL and this file up to a more standard format. Added
	  missing test file from_root.t to MANIFEST. Change README to
          README.md. Added a CONTRIBUTING.md file.
	- It looks like I never released version 0.12. I probably
	  should release this version then.
0.12
     2013-05-20
	- Add the 'b' portion of the ->new() method. Works for
	  new BigRat and BigInt arguments, currently has no
	  affect for the array sequence method, although the
	  arguments are stored.
     2013-01-27
	- Fixed a documentation error and removed an unused variable as
	  pointed out by Saasha Metsarantala (my apologies for missing
	  diacritical marks in the name).

0.10
     2011-01-01
	- Very basic version released: Can create CF objects two
	  different ways, and return array form, ascii array form,
	  and convergents using BigRat and BigInt types.
